# Please, follow the installation instructions for the project

- Open the Project: Navigate to your project's root directory using your terminal.

- Ensure that your Node version is not lower than the recommended one. Recommended version: v18.16.0

Run the script below in the root folder to install the necessary npm packages (equivalent to npm install).

  `node install-subprojects.js`
  
- Run the following command from the project's root directory to start the development server:

  `npm run dev`

This command will start both the backend server on port 1337 and the frontend on port 3000.

# Access the Server and Frontend:

- To access the backend server, open your web browser and go to:

[http://localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337)
This is where the server should be running.

- To access the frontend part of your application, open your web browser and go to:

[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
This is where the frontend part of your project should be available.

Now you should be able to interact with your project's frontend and backend locally using the specified ports. Make sure to follow any project-specific instructions for further development and testing.
